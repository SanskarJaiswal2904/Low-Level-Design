# Low-Level-Design
This repository is a collection of well-structured Low-Level Design (LLD) implementations, demonstrating key software design principles and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It serves as a reference for designing scalable, maintainable, and modular software systems.


1. **Chess**:  
   A simulation of the classic game of Chess using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project includes features like player turns, valid moves for each piece, check, and checkmate detection.

2. **Elevator**:  
   Models the working of an elevator system. It handles requests, moves between floors, and optimizes for efficient operation while considering multiple users with multiple elevators.

3. **GameArcade**:  
   A system simulating an arcade where users can book and play various games. It include functionality for game selection, payment system.

4. **HotelManagementSystem**:  
   Manages hotel operations, including room booking, customer check-in/out, room availability tracking, and billing.

5. **LoggingFramework**:  
   A custom logging tool to track events or actions in applications. It includes features such as different log levels (info, debug, error) and saving logs to files or a database.

6. **MovieTicketSystem**:  
   A ticket booking system for a movie theater, including seat selection, ticket availability, pricing, and movie selection.

7. **ParkingLot**:  
   Simulates the functionality of a parking lot, including parking spot allocation, vehicle tracking, and billing based on parking time.

8. **RateLimiter**:  
   Implements a mechanism to limit the rate of requests or actions in an application. Useful in APIs or distributed systems to prevent abuse or overloading.

9. **SnakeAndLadder**:  
   A recreation of the classic board game Snake and Ladder. Includes logic for dice rolls, player movement, and interactions with snakes and ladders.

10. **Splitwise**:  
    A system to manage group expenses and payments, similar to the popular app. It calculates individual shares and tracks balances between users.

11. **TicTacToe**:  
    A simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with two players. Features include turn management and win/draw detection. It also supports nxn board size.

12. **VendingMachine**:  
    Models the operation of a vending machine, including product selection, inventory management, payment processing, and dispensing items.
